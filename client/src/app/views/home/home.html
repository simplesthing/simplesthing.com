            <p>
              The past year was bittersweet, I grew professionally and personally, experienced great joys and deep pains, sometimes simultaneously.
              I attended a bunch of great conferences (<a
              href="http://forwardjs.com/">Forward 2</a>, <a href="http://presspublish.events/">Press Publish</a>, <a
              href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge</a>, <a href="http://www.alterconf.com/">AlterConf</a> <a href="http://2015.cascadiajs.com/">CascadiaFest</a>,
              <a href="http://osfeels.com/">Open Source &amp; Feelings</a> ) met a ton of awesome people, I started a <a
              href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Ladies-JS/">meetup group</a>, met more awesome people, I gave  my first technical talk at
              <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/">Seattle JS</a> in front of supportive awesome people and I quit my job without a another job lined up.

           <p>I had originally written a post about my decision to look for a new job, but after
           a nights sleep on it I decided to redact it. I'd rather just say that
             I am super excited to start my new job at <a href="http://www.lindenlab.com/">Linden Lab</a>.
              I'm equally excited to say that the product I will be supporting is one that I have been envisioning since I was doing 3D development in college, Virtual Reality worlds, finally! In their own words,
              <em>"Project Sansar is the codename of our new platform for user-created virtual experiences. Sansar will democratize VR as a creative medium and make it easy for people to create, share, and profit from social virtual experiences."</em>
              I couldn't be more invigorated and ready to start 2016, I have more drive and motivation now than ever as I look forward to coding, blogging, meetups and conferencing, I hope to see you around, IRL or online.

                      I have eight years of experience working on the front end and I've used nearly a dozen languages and frameworks while doing it, but the base three, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, are the ones I do best, with JavaScript being the most used in my daily work. I've spent the last two years working with Angular JS and most recently combining it with D3.
                    </p>
                    <p>Involvement in community and critically thinking of ways to improve how we work with one another is just as important to me as writing code. Our products, and how we make them, affect our understanding of self and each other. Inclusion of all personas and the practice of empathy leads the way to making better products and a better world.
