          <p>
          So many times in my career I have felt these two emotions simultaneaously, <br>
          "wow I know alot about web development" <br>
          "wow I don't know enough about web development". <br>
          Most the time it has to do with the people I am surrounded by and how I feel I am perceived.
        </p><p>
          I feel I know more when I am around people that are confident in themselves, and can connect on topics of web development from a place of shared enthusiasm. People that use respect and kindness when they speak and act.
        </p><p>
          I feel I know less when I am with people that feel they need to compete ruthlessly, for whatever reason, they must prove that they are dominant and they must win. People that use micro aggression and disregard others when they speak and act.
        </p><p>
          Full disclosure, I have an anxiety disorder. My disorder is not something you can see on the surface, like a disfigurement. It is hidden, deeply, and conscious care is taken with every interaction to keep it that way.
        </p><p>
          If you know me maybe you notice I wring my hands, I fidget, I laugh alot in conversation, often at the wrong time, I sweat, tremble and make mistakes when someone is watching me, and sometimes I have hard time focusing and relaxing. I realize how awkward I am, I think I know how annoying it is for others to be around me, and I am trying constantly to mitigate my feelings and the feelings of others. Just like my coding skills I never stop working on my social skills, I push myself to be present with my coworkers, attend conferences and organize meetups and be part of the local web development community.
        </p><p>
         After years of analysis I have learned that I am not alone. That underrepresented groups  in STEM are more likely to have these issues suggesting that lack of diversity is to blame. Regardless I need to make a living, and there is no other vocation in the world that I would rather have than web development.
        </p><p>
          Digital imaging and animation is how I got started with coding. I wrote my senior thesis on why I loved doing it so much. It is the only place where I felt in total control, I build the <em>thing</em> and I write the code that makes the <em>thing</em> behave the way I decide. Back then there were less actors on the stage, and competition, especially for the frontend was negligible. More than fifteen years later the web industry is overflowing with new voices, and opinions, about everything, and the frontend is like the wild west. Overwhelmingly alot of opinions are aimed at making others feel badly, like they don't belong, make them feel they are less than whomever is espousing those opinions.
        </p><p>
          I never entered web development to become rich and famous, or powerful. I did it for the pleasure of creating things and being part of web culture. I am thankful everyday that I have been able to pay my bills, have food, clothing, a place to live and to see a doctor when I am sick. That is why is continue to do it, but I also do all the extra work, the emotional labor, because I want to make it better for the next person that comes along. That is why I am sharing this today. I am a person that has fought hard to sit at the table, I want others that might feel unwanted, or unqualified to know that the only thing to limit you, is you. Yes the industry can be toxic, and yes people will try to keep you out, push you down and make you hurt. But there are also people that want to be supportive and encouraging and want you to learn the best way to exist in this space and excel, with respect and kindness. Others have helped me feel this way, a few key people have touched me and changed me, either personally or just by publicly speaking out. I survive by seeking out these voices online or by attending conferences where I know that kindness and empathy are the theme. In the spirit of anonymity I won't name them by name but I want to share a few true personal stories of how this happened to me.

          A manager at a very large well known Seattle company with an engineer focused culture, once told me in a time of depression and self doubt that he needed just one thing from me. He said that he didn't need me to write perfect code, or to know everything or to never make mistakes, but that one thing he needed from me was for me to not give up. Thank You.

          I once met a very famous, very opinionated, JavaScript programmer at a conference, and I asked him if I could take a photo with him after his talk. He was so gracious and kind when taking that photo that later that night I emailed him telling him how grateful I was for his work, that I had taught myself JavaScript from his book, the book that all JavaScript developers of the early 2000's learned from. How I had made a decent living from those skills I learned and how much he made a difference in my life. I expected that email to go out into the ether and never hear a response. He responded the very next day, with kindness and encouragement, saying that he was happy that I found a place in the industry and that he hopes that I continue to go places with my skills. Thank You.

          I was attending a conference of a small company in San Francisco that created a ubiquitous tool in the web development world. I spent my morning live tweeting the messages that the speakers were sharing about acting with kindness and creating an inclusive community. As the talks entered into a break I got up to grab a coffee and as I walked out of the aisle I looked up and the CEO of that company had his hand out with a smile on his face and said, "Hi you're Ava right, from Twitter?" I responded with some string of awkward words and ran away, but I felt a million miles high inside, I felt as though I belonged there. Thank You.

          If you are reading this I hope you take time to think about the people you interact with as people and not 10x programmer machines without feelings. If you made it this far I suspect you already do and so I thank you too.

                      I have nine years of experience working on the front end and I've used nearly a dozen languages and frameworks while doing it, but the base three, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, are the ones I do best, with JavaScript being the most used in my daily work. I've spent the last year working on node/React applications at Linden Lab.

                    <p>Involvement in community and critically thinking of ways to improve how we work with one another is just as important to me as writing code. Our products, and how we make them, affect our understanding of self and each other. Inclusion of all personas and the practice of empathy leads the way to making better products and a better world. I am interested in learning about and getting involved with community projects or events related to open web, open source software and geek feminism and I organize the meetup group <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Feminist-JS/">Seattle Feminist JS</a>.
