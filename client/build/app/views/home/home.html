                    <p>
                      I have over a decade of experience working on web sites and I've used at least a dozen languages while doing it, but the base three, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, are the ones I do best, with JavaScript being the most used in my daily work. I've spent the last two years working with Angular JS and most recently combining it with D3. I've dabbled a bit with node.js as a server language and I am always looking for the time to make something cool with it and React, Ember, Ionic, Material Design, Polymer, Python TypeScript, Johnny Five...<em>this list never ends....</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>Involvement in community and critically thinking of ways to improve how we work with one another is just as important to me as writing code. I organize Seattle Ladies JS in an effort to get involved and exert the effort it takes to positively effect change. Our products, and how we make them, affect our understanding of self and each other. Inclusion of all personas and the practice of empathy leads the way to making better products and a better world.
