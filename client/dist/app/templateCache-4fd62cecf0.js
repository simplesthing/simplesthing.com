At the time I felt so naive for not having found a community before that weekend. I had been living in Seattle, working as a web developer for seven years prior without a feeling of belonging to a community. I went through all the motions of unease with this and settled into isolation as a way of life, until one day I thought about giving tech up completely. I can still remember the tweet that encouraged me to apply to attend AdaCamp. I followed the link and filled out the application, nervous that I wasn&#8217;t qualified enough to attend. I hadn&#8217;t actually contributed to open source at that time, but I used open source code at work, did that qualify me to be part of the &#8220;open technology and culture&#8221; that they were talking about, I honestly didn&#8217;t know. I have been building interactive applications since the late 90&#8217;s, but somehow inside I felt unqualified, why? AdaCamp had the answer to that question and so many others that I had only myself to ask in a vacuum.</p><div ng-class=\"{\'text-fade\' : home.blogCollapse}\"></div></div><div collapse=home.blogCollapse><p>I am an awkward person socially, and usually especially with women, but I can remember my feelings of awkwardness diminishing in this environment. The other attendees were all so inspiring in who they were, what they do and how they cared for themselves and each other by being there. Talking about our experiences, and learning skills from those that were leading with intelligence and empathy I started feeling validated and my confidence level rose a thousand percent. What started as intimidating for me turned into a source of strength and inspiration in ways that I am having a hard time putting into words. I have been meaning to write this blog post for a year now! I owe this community this post, they have been there since that weekend, the support learning and growth doesn&#8217;t end after the weekend is over. I trust this community, I have asked questions on the alumni mailing list and I received thoughtful and encouraging responses.</p><p>I have been reminded of our connection through favs and retweets on occasion and last month when I impetuously tweeted from the train on my morning commute that I was thinking of starting a meetup group for women and JavaScript in Seattle, the support was there. A few retweets turned into a few more favs and by the time I got to work I was dead set on doing it. I need more of that AdaCamp spirit in my life, I wanted to start something up, I know now that there are more like us out there and we can and should support one another. By using what I have learned from being part of AdaCamp I hope I can inspire, teach and build confidence in other woman that might feel like they are unqualified or who might be thinking of giving up, even though they know they love coding. <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Ladies-JS/\" target=_blank>Seattle Ladies JS</a> had it&#8217;s first meetup this past weekend where we setup and ran a <a href=\"http://seattleladiesjs.github.io/gulp-development-environment/\" target=_blank>development environment using Gulp</a>, and it was a success. All of the ladies worked through issues together, we all learned and grew a little bit more confident together, and I know we can continue to do so.</p><p>Thank you AdaCamp for making me a stronger more involved member of the tech community. I encourage every woman that has any connection to open source and technology to attend at least one AdaCamp as soon as they can.</p><em>edited September 24, 2015</em><p>The Ada Initiative will no longer be holding Ada Camps, but they have left a resource <a href=\"https://adacamp.org/\" target=_blank>toolkit</a> behind to help spread \"Add a little bit of AdaCamp to all events.\" If you\'re an organizer of tech events that are trying to increase diversity, this is great place to start your planning.</p></div></div><div class=collapse-control><a ng-click=home.toggleBlog()>{{home.blogCollapseStatus}}</a></div></div></div></section></div></div></section>");

I attended a bunch of great conferences (<a href=\"http://forwardjs.com/\">Forward 2</a>, <a href=\"http://presspublish.events/\">Press Publish</a>, <a href=\"http://opensourcebridge.org/\">Open Source Bridge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.alterconf.com/\">AlterConf</a> <a href=\"http://2015.cascadiajs.com/\">CascadiaFest</a>, <a href=\"http://osfeels.com/\">Open Source &amp; Feelings</a> ) met a ton of awesome people, I started a <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Ladies-JS/\">meetup group</a>, met more awesome people, I gave my first technical talk at <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/\">Seattle JS</a> in front of supportive awesome people and I quit my job without a another job lined up.</p><p>Looking back I made some tough but ultimately good decisions and looking forward I hope to use my experience to help others through possibly similar times of uncertainty. The decision to quit my job came after I had tried to make my, at the time, current role the one that I had wanted. I was looking for growth in all directions, becoming a better developer by writing better code, communicating with my co-workers to work as a team and to earn a paycheck that was consistent with others in the industry. At first management sounded supportive of my goals, they paid for my plane and hotel to attend a conference and gave me time to attend one other with my own resources, and that seemed pretty cool. But when I returned and was hoping to talk about things that were new then like <code>class</code> syntax or <code>Object.freeze</code> I was met with a negative criticism of the JavaScript language in general and a dismissal of the conversation before there even was one.</p><p>I decided that their lack of interested wasn\'t personal, I rationalized that they preferred to support education for individuals rather than for teams, which wasn\'t the optimal environment but better than not supporting education at all. Realizing that my community was not inside those four walls but instead were those awesome people I mentioned before, I started a meetup group of my own. I wanted to replicate what I had felt at <a href=\"http://adacamp.org/\">Ada Camp</a> Portland in 2014, the idea is that we have round table like discussions with someone to generally guide the conversation but overall we are sharing what we know with each other in a friendly casual environment. I asked for some support from my manager to host an event at the office, and maybe sponsor some food. The initial response was that I had to ask the SVP about after hours usage of the office when by chance the office manager overheard me asking and she interjected that she could arrange it, and she did. I didn\'t dare ask for pizza after that awkward exchange, but the day of the event I wanted to again encourage comradery by asking my manager if he\'d like to come in and say something about the company, he looked up and said \"they\'re beginners right?\", I nodded. He didn\'t come which I couldn\'t help interpreting as he wasn\'t interested in supporting beginners, or maybe ladies, not sure which if either, in any case he wasn\'t into supporting me.</p><p>One of the product owners that had understood what I was going through on my team offered to have me as lead on her latest project. I jumped at the chance to architect a small analytics application and to teach two other developers Angular and D3. This was a really good opportunity for me and I ran with it. I researched and prototyped and iterated, worked with the design and backend teams and taught those two developers how to build this application. Things were feeling better, I was enjoying the product and the role and finally getting a team like feel from my two colleagues which I talked with daily about techniques and approaches to code and overall everyone involved with the project seemed pleased with it\'s progress.</p><p>As the launch date approached I starting feeling anxious about getting some kind of feedback from management. Business folks from out of town started flying in to demo the application, there was some buzz around the office about it and again the feeling was that we nailed it, we delivered what was asked for on time and without issue. So why wasn\'t my manger telling me I did a good job? Instead he practically hid from me, I requested a one on one with him to talk about this, and other issues. Why had I been there for over a year and had never been asked about my goals, no performance reviews, no one on ones? The responses to these questions were so disappointing that I told the product manager, whom had given me a great opportunity, that it wasn\'t enough for me and that I would be looking around for something better after launch. Startled to hear this she insisted that I share my feelings with the SVP, in her mind he would make it right, she had mentioned something along the lines of \"incentivising top performers\".</p><p>About that same time I had attended a conference talk by Lauren Voswinkel called <a href=https://modelviewculture.com/news/lets-talk-about-pay>Let\'s Talk About Pay</a> where she discusses pay inequality between racial and gender groups in the industry. The talk ended with a call to action, tweet your job title, years of experience and salary with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23talkpay&src=typd\">#talkpay</a>, so I did. I thought I was paid fair at the time but I received several replies to my admission and they were not positive, <em>\"That is pretty low to be honest\", \"I\'m so sorry to hear that\", \"I know a company that is hiring you should get in touch with them\".</em> I have since deleted this tweet based on other advice given during the same talk, I did not want my next salary to be contingent on my last, but rather my skills and experience.</p><p>So there I was, ready to meet with the SVP and discuss my performance, which I felt was above and beyond, and hopefully hear that I was appreciated and will be recognized with a positive performance review and a pay increase. I ended up leaving that talk with no pride, and a feeling of insignificance that made me wish I could leave the office and never come back. I was told that the things I valued were not valued in the existing culture, and that the culture would not be changing for my sake. That each developer is expected to perform at the levels that I was performing and that the ones that were not were expected to \"step up or step out\". There was no praise for the work I had done and certainly no mention of a raise.</p><p>The next day I started talking to contacts to find a company with a sincere interest in supporting developer growth and community. I was very particular about whom I would consider and what type of roles they would be. I arranged two interviews with what I felt were good places, but before I could go to my first interview an unexpected death in my family caused me to make the decision to quit my job before having another one lined up. I spent the first month and a half after quiting caring for my mother whom has dementia, without unemployment assistance, then went on to spend another month and a half looking for a new job. In the end this decision hurt financially but spiritually I came through it as a whole person without regrets and nothing but optimism for what comes next in my life. Not only did I get to spend some precious time with my mother I got some time to try out all the cool new things that I hadn\'t before like React, the latest Ember, testing with mocha and chai, switched to WebStorm from Sublime, got up to speed on ES6 and Angular 2 with TypeScript, I even tinkered on my <a href=https://github.com/simplesthing/tarot-VII>tarot</a> game, this version uses no frameworks other than Express and Mongoose on the backend.</p><p>I am super excited to say that I start my new job Monday at <a href=\"http://www.lindenlab.com/\">Linden Lab</a>, and that they have already blown me away with the company policy concerning fair pay. I\'m equally excited to say that the product I will be supporting is one that I have been envisioning since I was doing 3D development in college, Virtual Reality worlds, finally! In their own words, <em>\"Project Sansar is the codename of our new platform for user-created virtual experiences. Sansar will democratize VR as a creative medium and make it easy for people to create, share, and profit from social virtual experiences.\"</em> I couldn\'t be more invigorated and ready to start 2016, I have more drive and motivation now than ever as I look forward to coding, blogging, meetups and conferencing, I hope to see you around, IRL or online.</p></div></div></div></section><section id=work><div class=container><div class=row><div class=\"col-lg-12 text-center\"><h2>Work</h2><hr class=star-primary></div></div><div class=row><div class=\"col-sm-4 portfolio-item\" ng-repeat=\"item in home.portfolio\"><a class=portfolio-link ng-click=home.open(item.id)><div class=caption><div class=caption-content><em>{{item.name}}</em><br><em>{{item.date}}</em></div></div><img ng-src=images/portfolio/{{item.image}} class=img-responsive ng-attr-alt={{item.name}}></a></div></div></div></section><section id=about class=success><div class=\"container one-col\"><div class=row><div class=\"col-lg-12 text-center\"><h2>About</h2><hr class=star-light></div></div><div class=row><div class=col><div class=one-col><div class=row><div class=col><p>I have eight years of experience working on the front end and I\'ve used nearly a dozen languages and frameworks while doing it, but the base three, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, are the ones I do best, with JavaScript being the most used in my daily work.
